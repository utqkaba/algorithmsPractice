# Algorithms Practice Questions & Solutions

Daily JavaScript algorithm practice repository designed to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.
This repository includes common coding challenges focused on arrays, strings, sorting algorithms, recursion, and more â€” all implemented in vanilla JavaScript without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

The goal is to systematically enhance algorithmic thinking and coding fluency through consistent daily practice.
