Problem: Merge Two Sorted Arrays
Description: You are given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, with lengths m and n respectively.
The first array, nums1, has a length of m + n. The first m elements represent valid numbers, and the remaining elements are all zero (0) to provide space for merging.
The second array, nums2, has a length of n and contains valid sorted numbers.

Merge nums2 into nums1 in non-decreasing order as a single sorted array.
The merging must be done in-place inside nums1.

Example 1:
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3

Output:
nums1 = [1,2,2,3,5,6]
